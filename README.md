# Mathematics for Machine Learning
**In no way graded assignments  and exams needed to certificate will be shared due to the Coursera honor code**

**Please note that sometimes github doesn't load the .ipynb file or use a incorrect diagram for a matrix, feel free to download it and use in your own reader**

The aim of my repository is to give students learning the basis math for machine learning (in special those doing the Imperial College London Mathematics for Machine Learning course) some helpful resources and somewhere to guide then in the practice exercises available at the course.

This repository covers the following topics:

- Linear algebra;
- Multivariate Calculus;
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

**Basic course description (From Imperial College London course)**

*For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how itâ€™s used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.*

*In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.*

*The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.*

*The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.*

*At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.*
