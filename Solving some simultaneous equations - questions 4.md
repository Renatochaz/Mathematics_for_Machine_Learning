There is also the substitution method, where we rearrange one of the equations to the form 
x=ay+b or y=cx+d and then substitute x or y into the other equation. Use any method you'd like to solve the following simultaneous equations:
-2x + 2y = 20
5x + 3y = 6
Select the correct values of x and y below:
A. x=−3,y=7  
B. x=3,y=13  
C. x=5,y=15  
D. x=−5,y=5

Solve the simultaneous equations using the substitution method.
First, let's rearrange one of the equations to the form x=ay+b or y=cx+d.
From the first equation, we can rearrange it as:
-2x + 2y = 20
-2x = -2y + 20
x = y - 10
Now we can substitute this value of x into the second equation:
5x + 3y = 6
5(y - 10) + 3y = 6
5y - 50 + 3y = 6
8y = 56
y = 7
We can then substitute this value of y back into the equation we got earlier:
x = y - 10
x = 7 - 10
x = -3
Therefore, the correct values of x and y are:
A. x=−3,y=7
